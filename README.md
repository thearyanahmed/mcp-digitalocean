# MCP DigitalOcean Integration

MCP DigitalOcean Integration is an open-source project that provides a comprehensive interface for managing DigitalOcean resources and performing actions using the [DigitalOcean API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/). Built on top of the [godo](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo) library and the [MCP framework](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go), this project exposes a wide range of tools to simplify cloud infrastructure management.

> **DISCLAIMER:** "Use of MCP technology to interact with your DigitalOcean account [can come with risks](https://www.wiz.io/blog/mcp-security-research-briefing)"

## Installation

### Remote MCP (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to use DigitalOcean's hosted MCP services. Each service is deployed as a standalone MCP server accessible via HTTPS, allowing you to connect without running any local server. You can connect to multiple endpoints simultaneously by adding multiple entries to your configuration.

#### Available Services

### Claude Code

#### Remote MCP (Recommended)

To add a remote DigitalOcean MCP server to [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http digitalocean-apps https://apps.mcp.digitalocean.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual DigitalOcean API token.

You can add multiple services by running the command for each endpoint:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http digitalocean-databases https://databases.mcp.digitalocean.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"

claude mcp add --transport http digitalocean-droplets https://droplets.mcp.digitalocean.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

See the [Available Services](#available-services) section for the complete list of available endpoints.

#### Local Installation

To add the DigitalOcean MCP server to [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add digitalocean-mcp \
  -e DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN=YOUR_DO_API_TOKEN \
  -- npx @digitalocean/mcp --services apps,databases
```

This will:
- Add the MCP server under the default (local) scope — meaning it's only available inside the current folder.
- Register it with the name `digitalocean-mcp`.
- Enable the `apps` and `databases` services.
- Pass your DigitalOcean API token securely to the server.
- Store the configuration in your global Claude config at `~/.claude.json`, scoped to the current folder.

#### Verify Installation
To confirm it's been added:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

#### Inspect Details
To inspect details:
```bash
claude mcp get digitalocean-mcp
```

#### Remove Server
To remove it:
```bash
claude mcp remove digitalocean-mcp
```

##### User Scope

Local scope is great when you're testing or only using the server in one project. User scope is better if you want it available everywhere.

If you'd like to make the server available globally (so you don't have to re-add it in each project), you can use the `user` scope:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user digitalocean-mcp-user-scope \
  -e DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN=YOUR_DO_API_TOKEN \
  -- npx @digitalocean/mcp --services apps,databases
```

This will:
- Make the server available in all folders, not just the one you're in
- Scope it to your user account
- Store it in your global Claude config at `~/.claude.json`

To remove it:
```bash
claude mcp remove -s user digitalocean-mcp-user-scope
```

      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Verify Installation

1. Open Cursor and open Command Pallet ( `Shift + ⌘ + P` on Mac or `Ctrl+ Shift + P` on Windows/Linux )
2. Search for "MCP" in the command pallet search bar
3. Select "View: Open MCP Settings"
4. Select "Tools & Integrations" from the left sidebar
5. You should see "digitalocean" listed under Available MCP Servers
6. Click on "N tools enabled" (N is the number of tools currently enabled).

##### Debugging

To check MCP server logs and debug issues:
1. Open the Command Palette (⌘+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Developer: Toggle Developer Tools" and press Enter

## Prerequisites for Local Installation

If you're using the local installation method (not Remote MCP), you'll need:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- NPM (v8 or later)

You can find installation guides at [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Verify your installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Quick Test

To verify the local MCP server works correctly, you can test it directly from the command line:
```bash
npx @digitalocean/mcp --services apps
```

---

## Configuration

### Local Installation Configuration

When using the local installation, you use the `--services` flag to specify which service you want to enable. It is highly recommended to only enable the services you need to reduce context size and improve accuracy. See list of supported services below.

```bash
npx @digitalocean/mcp --services apps,droplets
```
